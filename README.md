**Introduction**

In this article, we will explore a simple Complaint Management System built using Python's Tkinter library. This application allows users to submit complaints by entering their full name, selecting their gender, and providing comments. The system also includes functionality to display a list of complaints.

**Key Concepts**

The code leverages several key concepts:

Tkinter: A standard GUI toolkit in Python for creating desktop applications.
Grid Layout: A method for organizing widgets in a grid format.
Event Handling: The application responds to user actions, such as button clicks.
Database Connection: The application interacts with a database to store and retrieve complaint data.

**Code Structure**

The code is structured as follows:
Imports: Necessary modules are imported, including Tkinter components and custom database and list management classes.
Configuration: The main application window is configured, including its size and title.
Styling: The appearance of the application is customized using styles.
Widgets: Various widgets (labels, buttons, entry fields) are created and placed in the grid.
Functions: Functions are defined to handle data saving and displaying the list of complaints.
Main Loop: The application enters the main event loop to wait for user interactions.
